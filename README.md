## 🛠️ Installation
Locate the dropdown menu labeled 'Code' to the left of the About section in the main page of this repository. From there, select your preferred cloning method from HTTPS, SSH, or the GitHub CLI. For this demonstration, we will be using the SSH method. Copy the link and head to your terminal. From the command line you should enter:

    git clone <INSERT_SSH_KEY_HERE>

Replacing the above placeholder with the link copied from GitHub. This will clone the repository into a local directory on your machine. And that's it! Happy Hacking! 🚀

## 👨‍🏫 Usage
This code is strictly for use in the International Coding Quizard's Gauntlet of Sorcerers and Sorcery 🧙‍♂️ and is only provided as material for study and otherwise double-checking implementation of various javascript and Web API functionality. Any violations of these use cases will see the offender flogged in the streets, held in the stocks for a brief period, and sent to a life in the cells of the black dungeon shortly thereafter. Screenshots of original mockup are included.
